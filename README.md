# A Simple Chat Program Allowing Multiple Clients
This program allows multiple clients connect to the server and send text messages. 
Each client is assigned a unique ID.
The server program creates a separate thread for each client and allows clients to connect to the server independently.
This code can be used for any client-server application that handles multiple clients via message passing.
